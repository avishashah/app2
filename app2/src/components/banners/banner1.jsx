You can help our charity team by donating clothes, food, stationary or anything. Your little help can bring a smile on a few faces
A Charity is an organisation that exists to enable one group of people to help another. It can sometimes be for animals or nature. Many of the best known charities were set up by people who felt passionate about a situation that they believed was wrong or preventable!
